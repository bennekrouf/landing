# How Forms Hack User Experience in a Bad Way - When AI Really Saves People?

## The Frustration of Forms: A Personal Struggle

Have you ever tried to book a flight or reserve a hotel room? If so, you’ve likely encountered the same frustration I feel whenever I use forms. The process is tedious, often making me question why it can’t be simpler. Let’s dive into how forms hack user experience and why AI might just be the savior here.

## Forms: The Unnecessary Obstacle

Forms are those structured input fields we encounter daily. While they serve a purpose for data collection, their design can be a nightmare for users. Imagine trying to navigate through endless dropdowns or scrolling endlessly on a tiny screen. It’s not hard to see why this is frustrating.

Take the example of booking a flight. I’ve tried it several times, and each time, I feel like I’m jumping through hoops just to make a simple plan. The options are overwhelming, and the process drags on longer than it should. On mobile devices, it’s even more annoying because the screen is small, making navigation cumbersome.

Schopenhauer’s philosophy sheds light on this issue. He talked about the Will versus Representation, highlighting how forms force users to translate their natural will into artificial structures. This translation can disrupt our flow of thought and intuition, turning a simple task into an ordeal.

## The Problem with Forms: They Don’t Get Us

Forms don’t account for how people think naturally. They force us into rigid structures that often fail to capture the complexity of human needs. When I try to describe a perfect weekend getaway in one sentence using a text box, it feels like I’m stuck in a maze of words with no way out.

This isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about user experience. Forms create unnecessary friction and frustration, making users feel like they’re navigating through a maze rather than smoothly completing their task.

## AI: The Bridge Between Will and Expression

AI can be the solution here. By allowing users to express their wants more naturally—through voice or free text—it interprets this input without forcing it into rigid structures. This is akin to cutting down the maze, making interactions smoother and more intuitive.

Think about it: our brains don’t operate in rigid, structured ways. AI can understand the user’s intent without making them conform to predetermined boxes. It’s like having a conversation where the system gets you without the back-and-forth hassle.

## The Key Takeaway: Rethinking Our Approach

Forms are a flawed solution to a simple problem. They complicate things and create unnecessary friction. Instead, we should design interfaces that let users express their needs directly. This shift from rigid structures to more natural interactions is where AI excels.

Imagine reserving a hotel without filling out multiple pages of forms. Picture the ease of specifying your needs in a conversation-like manner. This isn’t about replacing human intuition with machine learning but enhancing it, making interactions smoother and more user-friendly.

## The Future of User Experience

As we move forward, embracing smarter methods for data collection can save users from the hassle of forms. Trust-building is crucial here, ensuring users feel confident in the system’s ability to understand their input accurately. This balance between convenience and reliability will be key to widespread adoption.

In conclusion, while forms may serve a purpose, they shouldn’t be the default way to collect information. The future lies in interfaces that respect how people think naturally, using AI to make interactions smoother, less frustrating, and more user-friendly. It’s time we bid farewell to the maze of forms and embrace smarter solutions that truly put users first.
